# NWAPW-Project

Hello! Welcome to our app--Plant Identifier. The purpose of this app is to allow everyone to know more about the world around them. *The updated version of the app is in "Bronte's Branch", not the master branch!!!* In order to use this app (at this point), open Android Studio. Then open an existing project: "USE_THIS_ONE_FROM_NOW_ON". In the menu, go to "Run" and run the app. It will ask you to select an emulator. If there's already one, select that one. Otherwise, create a new emulator that is API 24 or later. It should run and then open the app in the emulator.

*If emulator is already open, you can skip above paragraph.

The app is fairly straightforward--go to "identify plants!" and select a photo.** Currently, as this app is not properly connected to the tensorflow model, the "select" button will cause the app to quit. If you would like to see what the results screen will eventually look like, go back to the menu screen (using the arrow in the bottom menu) and select "Results".

**you can download another image from chrome to select in app

Thank you!
-Bronte, Elaine, Julissa, and Scott
